# 👋 Hi, I'm Warren Judson

I'm an aspiring **Data Scientist** focused on building practical, real-world projects using Python, machine learning, and data visualization. I'm currently building a portfolio of projects to prepare for a career in data science and machine learning in Spring 2026.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
I'm working on a series of projects to showcase core data science skills:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Cleaning, exploring, and visualizing real-world datasets using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

2. **Predictive Modeling (Regression & Classification)**
   - Using scikit-learn to build, tune, and evaluate models like linear regression, decision trees, and logistic regression.

3. **Clustering & Unsupervised Learning**
   - Segmenting data using k-means and hierarchical clustering to discover patterns in unlabeled datasets.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Other:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Streamlit (upcoming)
