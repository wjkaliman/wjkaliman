# 👋 Hi, I'm Warren Judson

I'm an aspiring **Data Scientist** passionate about solving real-world problems using Python, machine learning, and data visualization. I'm currently building a portfolio of hands-on projects to prepare for a career in data science and machine learning in Spring 2026.

I am a **Computer Science** student at **Colorado Technical University**, graduating in **December 2025**. In January 2026, I plan to enroll in an AI/ML intensive program to deepen my expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven technologies.

## 🚀 Current Focus
I’m working on three foundational projects to demonstrate core data science skills:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world datasets using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Predictive Modeling (Regression & Classification)**  
   Building, tuning, and evaluating models with scikit-learn to solve practical prediction problems.

3. **Clustering & Unsupervised Learning**  
   Discovering insights in unlabeled data using algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering.

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environments:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
